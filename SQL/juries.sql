She is most known for reviving the old classical dance form of Natwari Nritya or the Raslila of Brindavan, which later evolved into the Kathak.[1][2][3]\n\nKathak is based on devotional Krishna poetry of the medieval centuries and the highly cultivated court poetry of the 18th and 19th centuries which celebrated shringara, the sentiment of love.\n\nUma Sharma\'s family hails from Dholpur in Rajasthan. Born in Delhi in 1942, Uma Sharma received her dance training from Guru Hiralalji and Girvar Dayal of the Jaipur gharana, and subsequently she became a student of Pandit Sunder Prasad of the Jaipur gharana who emphasised rhythmic footwork and its permutations. Shambhu Maharaj and Birju Maharaj noted gurus of the Kathak tradition of the Lucknow gharana, known for the art of abhinaya, subsequently Uma Sharma sought to achieve a creative fusion of the two.[1] Uma went to St. Thomas\' School (New Delhi) for schooling, and then graduated from Lady Shri Ram College for Women, also in New Delhi.\n\nCareer\nAfter having learnt the presentation of traditional items, she has widened the repertoire of Kathak by composing new dance numbers and full length dance-dramas on a variety of themes. Her dance drama Stree (Woman), has been known its powerful thematic content and artistic presentation. As a one-woman exposition Stree Kathak gives emotive thrust in depicting the position of Woman down the centuries and her search for an independent identity.\n\nUma has performed all over the country and participated in many a national and international festivals. She has been on performance tours to USSR, New Zealand, Australia, USA, Canada, Middle East, Japan and China, both on invitation from organizations abroad and as a representative of the Department of Culture and the Indian Council for Cultural Relations.\n\nUma Sharma runs her own School of Music and Dance in the capital and has trained a whole new generation of younger dancers.\n\nHowever, veteran dance critic and scholar Sunil Kothari of New Delhi, has criticized her dance as always being very Bollywood oriented in nature. He has also accused her of misusing her connections with various government officials to gain awards and publicity. Uma hasn\'t commented on such allegations.\n\nAwards\nIn 1973 she became the youngest dancer be conferred upon with the Padma Shri by Government of India,[4] and Padma Bhushan 2001.[5] She was awarded the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award and also the Sahitya Kala Parishad Award.

I want that who so ever meets me gets to feel the power of positive vibes.\n\nI always try to extract learnings from every experience encountered in life. I believe that life is lopsided with a bunch of positives favouring our wishes and dreams. The only need is to draft an optimism born plan for our inner conscious and behave accordingly. I am a believer in the fact that we become what we think we are. We attract our tomorrow.\n\nAs a Corporate Trainer, my Signature Workshop is based on the theme of THOUGHT ENGINEERING. “Every Achievement begins with a thought and likewise every failure can also be attributed to a thought” – the session on Thought Engineering deals with the Qualitative as well as Quantitative Management of Thoughts with an objective to enhance productivity. This two days module is an experiential, high impact session and I have received positive, optimistic and encouraging reviews from all participants till date. Specially those who have been regularly practicing the lessons taught in the workshop have recorded definite and measurable impact. The Self Energizing tool Blue & Brown synergizes the power of age-old spiritual wisdom with modern-day work-life practices in a professionally palatable format.\n\nI blog on TOI Blogs and also write a weekly motivation column \"Success Toolkit\' for Hitavada.\n\nDr Ajit Varwandkar \n\nFeatured', '2021-03-03 00:00:00', '2021-03-03 00:00:00', 0, 0, NULL),

She is also runs the Bharatiya Sangeet Sadan, Delhi, a classical dance and music academy, situated in New Delhi, founded by her father in 1946. She is most known for reviving the old classical dance form of Natwari Nritya or the Raslila of Brindavan, which later evolved into the Kathak.[1][2][3]\n\nKathak is based on devotional Krishna poetry of the medieval centuries and the highly cultivated court poetry of the 18th and 19th centuries which celebrated shringara, the sentiment of love.\n\nUma Sharma\'s family hails from Dholpur in Rajasthan. Born in Delhi in 1942, Uma Sharma received her dance training from Guru Hiralalji and Girvar Dayal of the Jaipur gharana, and subsequently she became a student of Pandit Sunder Prasad of the Jaipur gharana who emphasised rhythmic footwork and its permutations. Shambhu Maharaj and Birju Maharaj noted gurus of the Kathak tradition of the Lucknow gharana, known for the art of abhinaya, subsequently Uma Sharma sought to achieve a creative fusion of the two.[1] Uma went to St. Thomas\' School (New Delhi) for schooling, and then graduated from Lady Shri Ram College for Women, also in New Delhi.\n\nCareer\nAfter having learnt the presentation of traditional items, she has widened the repertoire of Kathak by composing new dance numbers and full length dance-dramas on a variety of themes. Her dance drama Stree (Woman), has been known its powerful thematic content and artistic presentation. As a one-woman exposition Stree Kathak gives emotive thrust in depicting the position of Woman down the centuries and her search for an independent identity.\n\nUma has performed all over the country and participated in many a national and international festivals. She has been on performance tours to USSR, New Zealand, Australia, USA, Canada, Middle East, Japan and China, both on invitation from organizations abroad and as a representative of the Department of Culture and the Indian Council for Cultural Relations.\n\nUma Sharma runs her own School of Music and Dance in the capital and has trained a whole new generation of younger dancers.\n\nHowever, veteran dance critic and scholar Sunil Kothari of New Delhi, has criticized her dance as always being very Bollywood oriented in nature. He has also accused her of misusing her connections with various government officials to gain awards and publicity. Uma hasn\'t commented on such allegations.\n\nAwards\nIn 1973 she became the youngest dancer be conferred upon with the Padma Shri by Government of India,[4] and Padma Bhushan 2001.[5] She was awarded the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award and also the Sahitya Kala Parishad Award.

She is also runs the Bharatiya Sangeet Sadan, Delhi, a classical dance and music academy, situated in New Delhi, founded by her father in 1946. She is most known for reviving the old classical dance form of Natwari Nritya or the Raslila of Brindavan, which later evolved into the Kathak.[1][2][3]\n\nKathak is based on devotional Krishna poetry of the medieval centuries and the highly cultivated court poetry of the 18th and 19th centuries which celebrated shringara, the sentiment of love.\n\nUma Sharma\'s family hails from Dholpur in Rajasthan. Born in Delhi in 1942, Uma Sharma received her dance training from Guru Hiralalji and Girvar Dayal of the Jaipur gharana, and subsequently she became a student of Pandit Sunder Prasad of the Jaipur gharana who emphasised rhythmic footwork and its permutations. Shambhu Maharaj and Birju Maharaj noted gurus of the Kathak tradition of the Lucknow gharana, known for the art of abhinaya, subsequently Uma Sharma sought to achieve a creative fusion of the two.[1] Uma went to St. Thomas\' School (New Delhi) for schooling, and then graduated from Lady Shri Ram College for Women, also in New Delhi.\n\nCareer\nAfter having learnt the presentation of traditional items, she has widened the repertoire of Kathak by composing new dance numbers and full length dance-dramas on a variety of themes. Her dance drama Stree (Woman), has been known its powerful thematic content and artistic presentation. As a one-woman exposition Stree Kathak gives emotive thrust in depicting the position of Woman down the centuries and her search for an independent identity.\n\nUma has performed all over the country and participated in many a national and international festivals. She has been on performance tours to USSR, New Zealand, Australia, USA, Canada, Middle East, Japan and China, both on invitation from organizations abroad and as a representative of the Department of Culture and the Indian Council for Cultural Relations.\n\nUma Sharma runs her own School of Music and Dance in the capital and has trained a whole new generation of younger dancers.\n\nHowever, veteran dance critic and scholar Sunil Kothari of New Delhi, has criticized her dance as always being very Bollywood oriented in nature. He has also accused her of misusing her connections with various government officials to gain awards and publicity. Uma hasn\'t commented on such allegations.\n\nAwards\nIn 1973 she became the youngest dancer be conferred upon with the Padma Shri by Government of India,[4] and Padma Bhushan 2001.[5] She was awarded the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award and also the Sahitya Kala Parishad Award. On 27 January 2013, she was honoured with title Srijan Manishi by Akhil Bhartiya Vikram Parishad, Kashi for her great contribution to Indian Kathak Dance.', '2021-03-04 00:00:00', '2021-03-04 00:00:00', 0, 0, NULL),

She is most known for reviving the old classical dance form of Natwari Nritya or the Raslila of Brindavan, which later evolved into the Kathak.[1][2][3]\n\nKathak is based on devotional Krishna poetry of the medieval centuries and the highly cultivated court poetry of the 18th and 19th centuries which celebrated shringara, the sentiment of love.\n\nUma Sharma\'s family hails from Dholpur in Rajasthan. Born in Delhi in 1942, Uma Sharma received her dance training from Guru Hiralalji and Girvar Dayal of the Jaipur gharana, and subsequently she became a student of Pandit Sunder Prasad of the Jaipur gharana who emphasised rhythmic footwork and its permutations. Shambhu Maharaj and Birju Maharaj noted gurus of the Kathak tradition of the Lucknow gharana, known for the art of abhinaya, subsequently Uma Sharma sought to achieve a creative fusion of the two.[1] Uma went to St. Thomas\' School (New Delhi) for schooling, and then graduated from Lady Shri Ram College for Women, also in New Delhi.\n\nCareer\nAfter having learnt the presentation of traditional items, she has widened the repertoire of Kathak by composing new dance numbers and full length dance-dramas on a variety of themes. Her dance drama Stree (Woman), has been known its powerful thematic content and artistic presentation. As a one-woman exposition Stree Kathak gives emotive thrust in depicting the position of Woman down the centuries and her search for an independent identity.\n\nUma has performed all over the country and participated in many a national and international festivals. She has been on performance tours to USSR, New Zealand, Australia, USA, Canada, Middle East, Japan and China, both on invitation from organizations abroad and as a representative of the Department of Culture and the Indian Council for Cultural Relations.\n\nUma Sharma runs her own School of Music and Dance in the capital and has trained a whole new generation of younger dancers.\n\nHowever, veteran dance critic and scholar Sunil Kothari of New Delhi, has criticized her dance as always being very Bollywood oriented in nature. He has also accused her of misusing her connections with various government officials to gain awards and publicity. Uma hasn\'t commented on such allegations.\n\nAwards\nIn 1973 she became the youngest dancer be conferred upon with the Padma Shri by Government of India,[4] and Padma Bhushan 2001.[5] She was awarded the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award and also the Sahitya Kala Parishad Award.

The dominance of creativity, at first, came through my paintings, and very soon I switched over from Nature on canvas to Nature as canvas, beginning to assist people in beautifying their open yards believing in the fact that knowledge is meant to be shared and not to be taken to the grave in a box. Environment and green surroundings have been an infatuating obsession in my life. I have enthusiastically undertaken many assignments concerning gardening, landscape development and overall augmentation of the aesthetics of a place. For more than a decade now I have been playing with the spectroscopic tints and hues of the flora around us, gaining immeasurable satisfaction. I have also delivered many awareness lectures pertaining to issues like health, hygiene and environment to underprivileged people. My fascination with the occult led me to pursue a course in Vedic Astrology from Bhartiya Vidya Bhawan (Delhi), which I find to be a highly relevant and practical science. I relish listening to and participating in discussions, particularly those concerning social issues and involving the young. \nMy present engagements include content writing, book writing, composing poems and contributing regular columns for Garhwal Post, a daily English Newspaper, where I pen film reviews, an ongoing series on ‘Beautiful Gardens of Doon’ and a series called ‘This time will be remembered’ during the corona pandemic, with any other interesting topic catching my interest. \nI stand by my belief that the youth has tremendous potential to effectuate positive transformation.\n\n\n', '2021-03-04 00:00:00', '2021-03-04 00:00:00', 0, 0, NULL),

She is most known for reviving the old classical dance form of Natwari Nritya or the Raslila of Brindavan, which later evolved into the Kathak.[1][2][3]\n\nKathak is based on devotional Krishna poetry of the medieval centuries and the highly cultivated court poetry of the 18th and 19th centuries which celebrated shringara, the sentiment of love.\n\nUma Sharma\'s family hails from Dholpur in Rajasthan. Born in Delhi in 1942, Uma Sharma received her dance training from Guru Hiralalji and Girvar Dayal of the Jaipur gharana, and subsequently she became a student of Pandit Sunder Prasad of the Jaipur gharana who emphasised rhythmic footwork and its permutations. Shambhu Maharaj and Birju Maharaj noted gurus of the Kathak tradition of the Lucknow gharana, known for the art of abhinaya, subsequently Uma Sharma sought to achieve a creative fusion of the two.[1] Uma went to St. Thomas\' School (New Delhi) for schooling, and then graduated from Lady Shri Ram College for Women, also in New Delhi.\n\nCareer\nAfter having learnt the presentation of traditional items, she has widened the repertoire of Kathak by composing new dance numbers and full length dance-dramas on a variety of themes. Her dance drama Stree (Woman), has been known its powerful thematic content and artistic presentation. As a one-woman exposition Stree Kathak gives emotive thrust in depicting the position of Woman down the centuries and her search for an independent identity.\n\nUma has performed all over the country and participated in many a national and international festivals. She has been on performance tours to USSR, New Zealand, Australia, USA, Canada, Middle East, Japan and China, both on invitation from organizations abroad and as a representative of the Department of Culture and the Indian Council for Cultural Relations.\n\nUma Sharma runs her own School of Music and Dance in the capital and has trained a whole new generation of younger dancers.\n\nHowever, veteran dance critic and scholar Sunil Kothari of New Delhi, has criticized her dance as always being very Bollywood oriented in nature. He has also accused her of misusing her connections with various government officials to gain awards and publicity. Uma hasn\'t commented on such allegations.\n\nAwards\nIn 1973 she became the youngest dancer be conferred upon with the Padma Shri by Government of India,[4] and Padma Bhushan 2001.[5] She was awarded the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award and also the Sahitya Kala Parishad Award.

She is most known for reviving the old classical dance form of Natwari Nritya or the Raslila of Brindavan, which later evolved into the Kathak.[1][2][3]\n\nKathak is based on devotional Krishna poetry of the medieval centuries and the highly cultivated court poetry of the 18th and 19th centuries which celebrated shringara, the sentiment of love.\n\nUma Sharma\'s family hails from Dholpur in Rajasthan. Born in Delhi in 1942, Uma Sharma received her dance training from Guru Hiralalji and Girvar Dayal of the Jaipur gharana, and subsequently she became a student of Pandit Sunder Prasad of the Jaipur gharana who emphasised rhythmic footwork and its permutations. Shambhu Maharaj and Birju Maharaj noted gurus of the Kathak tradition of the Lucknow gharana, known for the art of abhinaya, subsequently Uma Sharma sought to achieve a creative fusion of the two.[1] Uma went to St. Thomas\' School (New Delhi) for schooling, and then graduated from Lady Shri Ram College for Women, also in New Delhi.\n\nCareer\nAfter having learnt the presentation of traditional items, she has widened the repertoire of Kathak by composing new dance numbers and full length dance-dramas on a variety of themes. Her dance drama Stree (Woman), has been known its powerful thematic content and artistic presentation. As a one-woman exposition Stree Kathak gives emotive thrust in depicting the position of Woman down the centuries and her search for an independent identity.\n\nUma has performed all over the country and participated in many a national and international festivals. She has been on performance tours to USSR, New Zealand, Australia, USA, Canada, Middle East, Japan and China, both on invitation from organizations abroad and as a representative of the Department of Culture and the Indian Council for Cultural Relations.\n\nUma Sharma runs her own School of Music and Dance in the capital and has trained a whole new generation of younger dancers.\n\nHowever, veteran dance critic and scholar Sunil Kothari of New Delhi, has criticized her dance as always being very Bollywood oriented in nature. He has also accused her of misusing her connections with various government officials to gain awards and publicity. Uma hasn\'t commented on such allegations.\n\nAwards\nIn 1973 she became the youngest dancer be conferred upon with the Padma Shri by Government of India,[4] and Padma Bhushan 2001.[5] She was awarded the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award and also the Sahitya Kala Parishad Award.

She spent her formative years there and had a really happy childhood.\n\n“I have great memories of growing up in a house full of cousins, grandparents, food, dogs, and laughter. Those were carefree days with practically no gadgets and a lot of outdoor fun and games. I was very close to my grandparents and miss them very much even now.”, she says.\n\nEnded up in publishing by accident\n\nAfter finishing school, Milee moved to Delhi. She studied English literature at Hindu College, Delhi University and did her masters. She was then pondering about what to do next.\n\n“I was confused about what to do after my Masters and a friend recommended that I try publishing.”, she says.\n\nShe began her publishing career at Rupa & Co and then went on to join Random House India as a Commissioning Editor in 2008. The first book she edited was actually a fun quiz book. While at Random House, she commissioned, acquired and published bestselling books including From XL to XS, Jugaad Innovation, Dhandha, the IIMA Business series and the MINT Business series. She has been responsible for shaping Random House India’s list of popular fiction and non-fiction in all areas of lifestyle as well as business publishing.\n\nIn 2014, Penguin and Random House merged and the merged entity became Penguin Random House India. Milee was appointed as a director of publishing. She continued to work passionately and published a series of bestsellers and rose to the position of Editor-in-Chief for Commercial and Business books at Penguin Random House India.\n\nFocussing on discovering the best Indian talent and promoting debut writers, she published a range of bestsellers across different segments. Her authors include Amjad Ali Khan, Yuvraj Singh, Payal Gidwani Tiwari, L K Advani, Piyush Pandey, Hussain S. Zaidi, Karan Johar, Ravi Subramaniam, Twinkle Khanna, Navi Radjou, Shilpa Shetty, Suhel Seth, Emraan Hashmi, Sonali Bendre and Radhakrishnan Pillai to name a few.\n\nA day in the life of an Editor in Chief\n\nMilee says, “A regular day for me includes desk work, interactions with my team, meeting authors, agents, and sometimes attending events. My days are normally packed and you have to be self motivated to survive in this industry. It is a dynamic business and you need to constantly reinvent yourself while staying true to the basics.”\n\nWhen asked about the most challenging part of her job, she says,\n\n“Convincing authors to sign up without a huge advance! I really hope that the readership grows substantially and we are able to pay writers more in terms of advances and royalties.”\n\nWhat to publish?\n\nGiving a peek of what goes on behind the scenes, she says, “We have a core team that debates on book proposals and decides what to publish. It is an in depth and intense process as we are very particular about our publishing list. For non fiction it is more straightforward. If the subject is fresh, relevant and the author the best person to write the book on that subject, it is an easy call. For fiction, you need to go by your  gut. The things to consider are the plot, characterization, style of writing, and whether it makes you turn the pages or not.”\n\nOn the current publishing scene in India\n\n“I feel we are going through an interesting phase, a churn in publishing. The industry is growing and the dynamics are changing fast. Publishers and authors need to be foresighted, intuitive and experimental. I am confident that the future of publishing especially in India is bright, and we will see new literary talents coming to the fore.”, she says.\n\nWorking with Bollywood celebrity authors\n\nMilee has worked with Karan Johar, Twinkle Khanna, Shilpa Shetty, Emraan Hashmi, Sonali Bendre, etc. Sharing her experience of working with them, she says, “It’s been a revelation to see how hard work and discipline are important for success in any industry.

Her ideas and concepts often derive\nfrom the study of change in the topography as a result of rapid\ngrowth and modernization. She expresses these in the form of\nInstallations, sculptures, paintings, site-specific art works and short\nfilm. Overtime her country and travel has become an important\nstimulus in her creative process. Aarti’s artwork is a representation\nof what she perceives and feels while exploring various places,\nsituations and meeting different people. Growing up in an industrial\ntown she has lived between machines and nature. This dysfunctional\nrelationship between the two is the route cause of her curiosities. Her\njourney is more of a visual creation rather than a deep philosophical\nconclusion.\nAarti is the Vice-President of a Delhi based organization called\n‘TREES.’ She is also associated with “Global Nomadic Art Project”\nin collaboration with YATOO; a Korean art organization. She has\ngained a lot of experience in Public and Land art through her various\nresidency programs. She is also an active member of the AININ;\nArtist In Nature International Network.

A cancer survivor, she is living her second life queen size.\n\nHer story\n\nEveryone wants to be famous. The things we do for ourselves — work out, do make-up, dress well — it is all because we want to look good and when we enter a place we want people to look at us.\n\nI don’t hide my age. My granddaughter is seven and my grandson is five. I married at 17. Initially, I was a homemaker. I raised my children, took care of my family. Then eight years back I had throat cancer and lost all hope. It took me a year-and-half to get back on my feet. Once I realised I had not died I wanted to do something and show people I was not over. It was a challenge. I started working — opened the salon — and started going to parties.\n\nPeople think we are social butterflies. When this show came, I thought here’s a chance to show what I actually am. We were just ourselves on the show. At times, I was nervous as I have this problem of talking — I lisp because of the surgery — but the production team helped me out.\n\nWhen I got a call from Zee and told my sons, both said no. They said my health won’t permit me. My husband wondered if someone was playing a prank. But gradually they supported me.\n\nI wake up at 5.30am and am in the gym by 7. I make breakfast for everyone and then visit my salon or spend time at the factory. This is a message to all the (aged) ladies who think it’s all over. Why? Our first innings was for our family. Now we should give priority to ourselves. I wear the shortest of clothes. I look fair enough, not vulgar. My grandson says: “Dadi, you are going to party again! Table pe chad ke mat dance karna!” That is what I do when I am high (laughs). My granddaughter says: “Dadi, you look hot.” She is the one who clicks my Instagram pictures.\n\nI plan what to wear in a party when I travel from work to home. So once I reach my mind is set. By the time we are having dinner, I start doing my make-up. It takes me just half an hour to dress and I look the best! Once everyone goes to sleep I am off for the party.

Having achieved success and carving a name for myself in the entrepreneurial world, I am looking forward to new opportunities to give back to society the warmth and courtesies extended towards me.\n\nBorn in a small town at Gobind Garh in Ludhiana in 1953 as a daughter to Shri Hari Chand Goyal, a renowned industrialist, manufacturing RMI bicycles, Milk Products, Ghee and Steel Strips, etc. and graduated in Master of Psychology from Punjab University, Chandigarh, I got married to Mr. Mukesh Sharma of Interads Group, Delhi. Since childhood, I had an urge to change lives, make a difference and make a mark for my family and myself.\n\nBeing the wife of a visionary and ambitious man, mother to 3 God Gifted Children (One Daughter and Two sons) and now a grand mother, has given me strength and inspiration to achieve what I have and yearn for more.\n\nAssisting my husband during his start up in the exhibition industry in the earlier years, while bringing up three children, in tough financial times, was a challenge we accepted with a smile and new hope. Starting from a one-bedroom house on rent in Lajpat Nagar, I have helped my husband grow and prosper to owning various properties in India, UK, and living a comfortable and secure life.\n\nI have run a Small Scale industry of manufacturing paint brushes, household brushes and industrial brushes for leading government organizations, such as railways, defense, where goods were also exported to Russia and other countries and raw material were procured from Saharanpur and Bijnour, etc. The unit also succeeded in winning supply of Binaca toothbrushes and Harpic toilet brushes, which are being supplied to Reckitt Benckiser India Ltd till date.\n\nEven during handling production and expanding brush manufacturing plant in the 1980s, I knew my main area of interest was in Fashion and Lifestyle, a term not so well known at that time. My first step into the world of Fashion was my brainchild of opening a Fashion boutique catering to the Higher and Upper Middle Class under the name and style of Flair, and since then there was no looking back. Running a successful fashion boutique in the heart of New Delhi caught the attention of Shehnaz Herbals, who approached me to add a beauty parlor division to Flair. By mid 90’s, my name was synonymous with Fashion industry.\n\nWhile the boutique and beauty parlor were running smoothly, I was assisting my husband in pioneering the Exhibition industry by organizing the first ever Delhi International Motor Show, First India International Travel & Tourism Exhibition, First India Healthcare Exhibition, Power Generation, Oil And Gas Exhibition in 1994 – 1996. These shows gained a lot of popularity and became annual events. Starting with initially 10 staff members, the organization has grown to strength of 200 workers today, attributable to the dedication and hard work of my husband and myself.\n\nIn 1996, I initiated a new theme, never before tested in the exhibition industry. I led a team of young marketers to organize the first ever Jewellery Show, which attracted the leading jewellers from all over the world making the show a mega success. The year after the first show witnessed 100% retained clients, with an additional flow of interested exhibitors and visitors waiting eagerly for the future editions. The success in these endeavors opened new avenues and inspired me to further widen the spread of Fashion and Lifestyle.\n\nWith the support of my daughter in 2000, beautiful ideas of a Complete Wedding Show erupted, to which my daughter gave a wonderful title “Bride & Groom”. The theme of the show was anything to everything connected to the Wedding industry displayed under single roof, from clothes to jewellery, from wedding cards to party dresses.\n\nThe grand success of the show and persuasion of the participants convinced me launch the show subsequently in other states of India as well as internationally, and since then Bride and Groom has become a regular show in 5 – 6 different venues i.e. Delhi, Hyderabad, Ludhiana, Bangalore, Bangkok, London, Malaysia and Jakarta. We have been constantly conquering new venues every year, trying to spread the Indian Wedding industry all over the world. Bride & Groom has brought enormous name and fame to ITE.\n\nAfter the success of Bride & Groom, I was still looking for more exposure and opportunities to grow. I set up a fashion village, which I always wanted to since the time of Flair. After winning the Management & Operational contract for Garden of Five Senses – a prime property in South Delhi, a beautiful piece of land lying as a deserted place, I set up a fashion village with hand picked designers, who set up their studios at the “ITE Designerville”.\n\nDuring this time, my Daughter wanted to pursue publishing as she is a creative writer and we established a Lifestyle magazine by the name of “Bride & Style” magazine. It has carved a special place for itself in a very short time being the most popular wedding magazine, answering all questions of people planning a wedding.\n\nMy husband for the last 7-8 years has moved into the Exhibition venue industry, creating and managing Expo Centres and left the organization of Exhibitions and events on my shoulders independently. Since then, I have created a team of young women who have become my friends and family and have supported me in managing and expanding my Exhibition, Fashion Village, Magazine business and helped me enter into new paths.\n\nWhile single handedly I have been managing my business, it has never hindered my social commitments and my responsibilities to give back what I have taken from the society. I am involved in various social projects like Blood Donation Camps, and assisting in upgrading the lives of down trodden by making them self-employed and creating self-confidence.\n\nMy plans for the future involve further such social endeavors to improve the quality of life for women all over and promote rights for women. Self-employment amongst women might be a dream difficult to achieve, but I believe it is not impossible, and if right support, guidance and confidence is imparted to the women, wonderful things can happen. I believe knowledge and awareness is the key to change and perhaps, a revolution. Being a part of FICCI Ladies Organization has made me proud to witness and be a part of the achievements of the organization, as well as of my fellow members. I truly believe FLO has set foot in the right direction and with able leadership and guidance, there are lot more battles to win and forts to conquer.\n\nI am also working with NGOs for various projects like fund raising, blood donations camps. I have been involved in such social activities since my college days, which gives me a sense of internal satisfaction and motivation to do more. My future plans also involve setting up a college for vocation training for needy women and children for them to be able to support themselves, and also setting an old age home.\nWith regard to my business, I have plans to further explore newer markets and spread the Indian culture and heritage around the globe. I wish to take the Bride & Groom exhibition to Mauritius, Canada, Japan and other cities around the world to promote Indian designers all over.\n\nEven though life has showed my family and myself various ups and downs, we have always emerged as stronger and successful through the difficult times and motivated and confident through the good times. Starting with nothing in 1980 and gaining respect through the years, I believe God has been very kind and our friends and families have been very supportive. Although, I have achieved so much in life, made a name for myself, I still have more ambitions and dreams that I want to fulfill and battles to win.', '2021-03-05 00:00:00', '2021-03-05 00:00:00', 0, 0, NULL),

But what if one is been in a startup mode for the longest time? Beauty expert and naturalist Suparna Trikha has been in that mode close to two decades, she is now ready to launch her beauty range. Speak with her for just a little while and she can logically convince you to move towards nature. She doesn’t ask one to shun modernism but only asks one to be more responsible and do what we did years ago, be beautiful naturally. Upon her return to India from England in 1979, she enrolled for English (Hons) at Hansraj College. After a short stint as a copywriter, writing on environment for The Hindustan Times and having worked with Pakistan International Airlines, where she had the most glamorous life of Ghulam Ali and Reshma singing to her while waiting for their tickets, she thought her calling was elsewhere. “I joined Shahnaz Husain’s marketing and communications team but by about 1995, I still wasn’t happy,” says Suparna. This was also the time Suparna realised that women today are increasingly becoming aware of the products they pick up for their skincare regimen. Being close to nature, and coming from a family where her maternal grandfather was the Vice Chancellor and Chancellor of the Gurukul Kangri (of which Baba Ramdev has also been a student), it was quite natural that Suparna would be inclined to start on her own on the same path. “Because of my maternal grandfather we had all the vaids visiting us. We were surrounded by nature and herbs. And I eventually started researching, speaking to vaids, and visiting gurukuls across the country. I started learning more about herbs and their healing powers, about bhasms and so on. I also started writing down my formulations and recipes. Armed with my updated knowledge and products, I set up a modest treatment centre at the basement of my home in New Delhi. I could not hire any designer so we did the interiors ourselves. We kept the look homely with traditional colours and furniture at an age when spas were going for modern and niche looks. But I knew my products and what I was getting into.” Sign up for our exclusive newsletters. Subscribe to check out our popular newsletters. Suparna ‘s first product was the banana bouncer for hair and the recipe called for a dozen bananas along with a mix of 37 herbs. This recipe makes hair healthy by nourishing hair and promoting its growth. “Every evening my friend and I would take charge of my mother’s kitchen mixie and grind all kind of herbs, lentils, brahmi, almonds, reetha, shikakai for my products and one day the mixie burnt out. I got a firing of my life and she threw us out of her kitchen,” laughs Suparna. “I was at a loss because clients had started to come back and new clients through referrals were pouring in too. I do pedicure with hot milk as milk is a natural moisturiser and a natural de-tanner. What my clients also realised was that, when we said herbal, the products were as herbal as it could get. We did not use any fancy perfume to make the products smell better. They just smelt of the ingredients that I was using like neem, mint, camphor, clove, etc. Using natural products also meant a shorter shelf life unlike what was available in the market that could be used for a longer period,” she adds. At the same time, Suparna started her column with the Telegraph which really established her presence in the world of beauty. She was giving talks and speaking at conferences and lectures about how she was not giving anything new to people and that she was just taking people back in time. With a clientele like Shubha Mudgal, Shabana Azmi, Nandita Das, Meera Nair coming for treatments and products that spoke for themselves, Suparna got into selling her concoctions as well. “Because of the volumes I was doing and the burnt mixie episode, my mother suggested that I get a chakki. Therefore, I got an industrial pulveriser in the basement. In between I also tried sourcing powdered products from the market and stumbled upon some adulterated stuff that put me off. I remembered my father telling me, ‘charge whatever you want, but never give in to quality. If it is almond oil you are giving then it has to be the purest almond oil with no synthetic oil mixed to it.’ So we went back to grinding our own stuff,” shares Suparna. Making her products got her to think about branding. “Till now I was working under the brand name Suparna’s Aveda and for a long time people used to call me Ms. Suparna Aveda. It is only now that I am working on branding myself. In the process, I have acquired a land and constructed a factory where I will produce my range of products commercially. Well-wishers came with all kind of suggestions like – Herbies, etc, but it got me thinking that, all these 18 years all that I have built up is my name and I should use it for my label – Suparna Trikha,” she shares. “There is no Indian brand on a global map, unlike the West where Nina Ricci, Estee Lauder which were founded by women and branded themselves just that. My aim is to have my products speak about the East to West,” she adds.Operatig in the niche market, she has had her fair share of success. She was commissioned to do a luxurious ubtan for the famous Sahara wedding, which took her six months to research. She studied what the Mughals used and created her own wedding ubatna made of powdered gold, silver, petals of different flowers, and dry fruits. It was such a hit that she caters these secret formulations, for destination weddings in Thailand, Mauritius, and Sri Lanka. While startups look for opportunities to be present in front of their audience after the product launch, Suparna has worked the other way round. Even before the formal launch of her range of products, she is already doing shows on NDTV and writes for nine magazines and newspapers across the world about beauty and healthy living. The future For Suparna Trikha, the brand, “The licences have just come in about a year and a half back and I have learnt a lot about red tapism,” tells Suparna. “We have had people from across the world who has visited us for starting our franchises and so on. We are also looking at opening up treatment centres which have the same look and feel and treatment like our main centre. And we now finally hope to start retailing our range of 35 products soon! We are looking for partners who can take care of the marketing and I can just concentrate on making my formulations and recipes,” she says. She is also working on her second book which is devoted to men (The first book was in 1999, The Harper Collins Book of Natural Skin Care), because she realises that in India men have no idea of personal grooming and for any advice related to skin, acne, hair, etc., they ask their mothers, sisters, and wives for advice. She feels there is a serious lacuna in this space. Social cause It was in 1998 when Vandana Shiva of Navdanya approached Suparna Trikha to make gulal. Post every holi she had women coming in with skin burns and irritations caused by the colours. Resultantly, she started making herbal gulal with rose petals and other flowers, which has now become a yearly ritual. “Shiela Dixit (Former Chief Minister of Delhi) and our patron wanted us to go to various schools and educate children promoting environment classes with natural holi colours. So I came on panel with The Shriram School and Tagore International School to work with the children,” tells Suparna. “Then she egged us to do something for Diwali and we started working towards smoke-free diyas,” she shares. Suparna has also found a way to help women become independent. Peaches, plums and rhodedendrons grow in abundance around her cottage in Ranikhet, so she buys the fruits and has trained the women and given them space so they can make fruit preserves. From a startup, that has garnered cover credits for the Time Magazine, Suparna Trikha has come a long way, truly upholding the concept of Make in India.\n\nRead more at: https://yourstory.com/2015/10/suparna-trikha', '2021-03-05 00:00:00', '2021-03-05 00:00:00', 0, 0, NULL),

Later on, the duo decided to start their own practice in India and finally in 2010, they came up with a design firm known as Studio Symbiosis which in a very short span of time got renowned across the country and has won various accolades and recognitions. The firm has been involved in varied ranges of projects including villas, hotels, sports city, Masterplan and other projects of various scales.\n\nDefining the term \'symbiosis\' the firm said, \"Elements of program, site, context, landscape and climate are studied and interfaced, thereby resulting in the amalgamation of these design considerations in one coherent design and resonating the term \"symbiosis\" in the design.\"\n\nAccording to the firm, \"In nature through the process of self-organization intrinsic patterns emerge. It is a system of inclusion of complexity as opposed to the system of exclusion. Instead of discarding information and creating a reduced whole, we like to integrate the complexity in the design, following the principal of inclusion, thereby resulting in an amalgamated design with a high level of sophistication.\" Digital tools along with local construction knowledge are embedded in the design. With most of the projects based in India, it is very critical to understand the local construction techniques which enable us to deliver a robust final project. A research based collaborative approach is employed by our office whereby analogue models and prototypes are critical in development of the designs.\n\nReal life phenomenon such as sun path diagrams, wind patterns, topographical levels, etc are studied both digitally and physically to instigate a design process where the overall form presents an optimum solution. This is an inherent part of the design process whereby a feedback loop is established that constantly updates the formal language of the project thereby embedding environmental sustainability in the form itself. India faces the extremes of climates in most places and for this reason, it is important to utilize these natural resources by making them work alongside the design.\n\nStudio Symbiosis\' projects have been widely published and the office has won a number of awards. Studio Symbiosis is involved in high profile projects that have been presented to Congress Chairperson Sonia Gandhi, C.M Akhilesh Yadav and MP of the Allahabad Constituency Rewati Raman Singh.\n\nHilton Ahmedabad, Trans Ganga Master plan, Kanpur Riverfront Redevelopment, Allahabad Master Plan are few of the firms\' key projects that are under construction, along with various other key projects at planning stage including Taj Ahmedabad, Taj Jodhpur, Mundra Hotel and service Apartments.', '2021-03-05 00:00:00', '2021-03-05 00:00:00', 0, 0, NULL),

I\nlearnt the ropes of litigation there, and enjoyed it enough never to\nwant to look at anything else!\nThe most advantageous part of beginning one\'s career in the\nSupreme Court is that, the majority of the practice in that Court\nbeing what is called \'SLP practice\', one gets exposure to a wide\nvariety of laws. Thus, during my initial 4 years in the practice, I dealt\nhands on with both, simple and complex issues in Constitutional\nLaw, Contracts, Civil Litigation, Administrative Law, Service and\nEmployment Law, Arbitration and many more laws across a diverse\nspectrum.\nAdditionally, I am thankful to my seniors at that firm for giving me\numpteen number of opportunities very early into my career to\nindependently appear and argue (before all Courts and Tribunals\nin New Delhi) matters as important as the defence of an MNC in a\ntemporary injunction application where stakes of several lakhs (if not\ncrores) in terms of damages were involved.\nHaving gone through the grind of drafting myriad pleadings and\nclocking numerous appearances, I next moved to the chamber of\na leading Senior Counsel of the Supreme Court in 2011. Under\nthe guidance of the very talented and extremely hard-working\nperson that my senior is, I (hope) I have imbibed within myself the\nimportance of hard work, the art of precision in law, and the craft of\nappearance in Court. In those years that I spent at the chamber, I\ndealt with issues of law of seminal importance in the field of Mining,\nPage 1 of 3\nElectricity, Arbitration, Company Law, Environmental Laws and\nBanking to name a few.\nIn all the years that I spent in these chambers, my desire to set up\nmy own litigation practice continued to burn bright.\nThat desire culminated in the founding of Innovatus Law.

In the early 1980s he was a member of The Medway Poets. In 1999 he named and co-founded the Stuckists art movement with Billy Childish. He has curated Stuckist shows, organised demonstrations against the Turner Prize, run an art gallery, stood for parliament and reported Charles Saatchi to the OFT. He is frequently quoted in the media as an opponent of conceptual art. He was briefly married to artist Stella Vine.\n\n\nContents\n1	Early life\n2	The Medway Poets\n3	Stuckism\n4	Stella Vine\n5	Sir Nicholas Serota Makes an Acquisitions Decision\n6	Art technique\n7	Gallery\n8	See also\n9	References\n10	Further reading\n11	External links\nEarly life\nCharles Thomson was born in Romford, London Borough of Havering, East London, and educated at Brentwood School, Essex, where he was a classmate of Douglas Adams. While still at school, he organised mixed media arts events and contributed to Broadsheet, a magazine edited by Paul Neil Milne Johnstone and published by Artsphere, a school arts group.[1] Outside school, he started the Havering Arts Lab. this resulted in a headline \"Sex Orgy Tale—Group Banned\" in the local Havering Express newspaper. In 1970 he produced a satirical magazine, called \'Lubricant\', which ran for 10 issues. In 1971 he stood (unsuccessfully) as a Dwarf candidate in the Havering council elections, and was involved in anti-pollution protests. He distributed \"underground\" magazines around London, including \"Schoolkids OZ\". In 1975 he went to Maidstone College of Art, where he was the only person in ten years to fail the painting degree. 1979–87 he worked part-time as a telephonist and receptionist at Kent County Ophthalmic and Aural Hospital. 1987–99 he was a full-time poet, with work in over 100 anthologies.[2]\n\nThe Medway Poets\nMain article: The Medway Poets\n\nSexton Ming, Tracey Emin, Charles Thomson, Billy Childish and musician Russell Wilkinson at the Rochester Adult Education Centre 11 December 1987 to record The Medway Poets LP\nIn 1979, Thomson was a founder member of The Medway Poets, a punk performance group, who read in pubs, as well as the Kent Literature Festival and the 1981 international Cambridge Poetry Festival. There were, however, personality clashes in the group, particularly between Billy Childish and Thomson, who said, \"There was friction between us, especially when he started heckling my poetry reading and I threatened to ban him from a forthcoming TV documentary.\"[3] However, a TV South documentary on the group in 1982 brought them to a wider regional audience. According to Childish: \"Me & Charles were at war from 1979 until 1999. He even threatened having bouncers on the doors of Medway poet’s readings to keep me out.\"[4]\n\nThomson has said this period was \"an incredibly pressured and creative time and established the basis on which we are still working.\"[5] Other members included future Stuckist artists Bill Lewis and Sexton Ming. Tracey Emin, then a local student, was on the outskirts of the group, being the girlfriend of Billy Childish. In 1987 Thomson printed her first book of writing, Turkish Tales, which had been edited by Lewis and was published by Childish.[6]\n\nStuckism\nMain article: Stuckism\n\nA Long Way from Greece\nIn 1999 Thomson was reconciled with Childish and together they founded the Stuckists art group with eleven other artists. Thomson coined the name \"Stuckism\" after an insult from Tracey Emin to ex-boyfriend Childish that he was \"stuck\", which Childish had recorded in a 1993 poem. The group stated its aims as promoting figurative painting and opposing conceptual art, being particularly critical of the Turner Prize and Charles Saatchi\'s promotion of Britart. Childish left the group in 2001 and Thomson remained as the figurehead, gaining extensive media coverage for his activities and outspoken views. In the meantime the Stuckists grew to a worldwide movement of over 100 groups in 30 countries.\n\nFrom 2000 to 2005 he staged yearly Stuckist demonstrations against the Turner Prize (making use of props such as clown costumes and blow-up sex dolls). He stood in the 2001 United Kingdom general election, as a Stuckist candidate against the then-Culture Secretary, Chris Smith. The same year he exhibited the then-unknown artist, Stella Vine (later made famous by Charles Saatchi). The couple married in New York and separated after two months.\n\n\nThe Stuckism International Gallery, Shoreditch, London\nThomson opened the Stuckism International Gallery in Shoreditch (2002–2005). In 2004 he reported Saatchi to the OFT (Office of Fair Trading) for alleged unfair trading practices in the art world: the complaint was not upheld. He co-curated the Stuckists\' first major exhibition in a public gallery, The Stuckists Punk Victorian show at the Walker Art Gallery, for the 2004 Liverpool Biennial. In 2005 he offered of a donation of 175 paintings by Stuckists artists from the Walker Gallery show to the Tate Gallery: this was rejected by the trustees. Later that year he obtained, under the Freedom of Information Act, Tate Gallery minutes about the purchase of a trustee Chris Ofili\'s work The Upper Room. This led to an ongoing press controversy about the purchase[7] and resulted in an official investigation by the Charity Commission, who censured the Tate in July 2006 for acting outside its legal powers.[8]\n\nIn June 2006 he wrote to the British Prime Minister Tony Blair asking him to intervene in the case of Stuckist artist Michael Dickinson, who was facing a possible 3-year jail sentence in Turkey for exhibiting a satirical collage of the Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.[9][10]\n\nIn October 2006, Thomson exhibited paintings and presented an academic paper in both the Triumph of Stuckism exhibition and symposium respectively . Both these events were organised by Naive John for the 2006 Liverpool Biennial at the invitation of Professor Colin Fallows, Chair of Contextual Studies at Liverpool School of Art and Design.\n\nHe writes a regular arts column for 3:AM Magazine, which carries work by a number of Stuckists, ex-Stuckists and their opponents.\n\nStella Vine\n\nLeft to right: Stephen Howarth, friend, Charles Thomson and Stella Vine at the Vote Stuckist show in 2001, where Vine exhibited her work publicly for the first time.[11]\nCharles Thomson was briefly married in 2001 to artist Stella Vine. She met Thomson[12] on 30 May 2001 at the private view of the Vote Stuckist show in Brixton, where she accepted his invitation to form The Westminster Stuckists group and to exhibit some of her paintings publicly for the first time in the show.[11] On 10 July, she renamed her group The Unstuckists.[13]\n\nThomson and Vine had a two-month relationship and they married on 8 August 2001 in New York.[14] The next day, Vine said she wanted a divorce; they had an intense row.[15] She left him and they did not meet again till a week later.[16] Vine said she could not cope with his controlling behaviour.[15] The marriage ended in 2001 after about two months.[17][18] They were granted a divorce in October 2003.[19]\n\nIn February 2004, after Vine \"rose to fame after being championed by Charles Saatchi\",[20] Thomson said that he was pleased that she had got success, but it was he and the Stuckists, not Saatchi, who had \"discovered\" Vine.[21] Vine said that Stuckism was a misogynistic cult,[19] that she had quickly realised that the marriage and the Stuckist group were not right for her,[22] and that her marriage to Thomson was \"an utter disaster\".[22] During the relationship Thomson had paid off Vine\'s debts of £20,000,[15] and Vine said she married him because this had been a condition of his funding her:[15] \"I couldn\'t face stripping any more and it was too bloody good to turn down.\"[15] Thomson said that they had a business arrangement to promote themselves as an art couple, there was no condition of marriage, and that she was \"really selling herself short\" by saying that was her motivation.[23]\n\nIn March 2004, Vine said that she had only seen Thomson once, in an art shop, in the previous two years.[15] She later told The Times that it was \"impossible to explain\"[24] why she married Thomson, that he didn\'t \"give a s*** about art or the Stuckist movement\",[24] and that he saw her as a means of gaining his own publicity: \"When I met him and he saw some of my history, he saw dollar signs. He is a very exploitative man.\"[24] In June 2007, Vine said that the marriage was consummated in 2001, a few weeks after the ceremony—\"I owed him that\"[12]—and Thomson then paid off her debts of £20,000, after which \"I\'ve never seen him again.\"[12]\n\nOn 28 March 2004, Thomson reported Saatchi to the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) for alleged breaches of the Competition Act and cited as an example Saatchi\'s promotion of Vine, a situation which made the row \"more bitter\".[25] The OFT said they did not \"have reasonable grounds to suspect that Charles Saatchi is in a dominant position in any relevant market\", which Thomson said was \"just another cruel smack in the face\" for Saatchi.[26] In September 2004, Vine threatened suicide if her work was included in The Stuckists Punk Victorian show at the Liverpool Biennial, and the owner of the painting withdrew it.[27]\n\n\nStrip Club\nIn October 2006, The Stuckists held a group show, Go West, at Spectrum London gallery, including two of Thomson\'s paintings, Stripper and Strip Club, \"explicit images of his ex-wife.\"[28] Thomson said the works would make Vine \"pissed off\",[29] but that she had painted images that were far more upsetting for people,[29] that he would prefer her to enjoy them as he did her art[30] and that they were painted as a catharsis not as an attack.[29] Vine said she had no comment.[29]\n\nIn July 2007, at the same time as the opening of Vine\'s major solo show at Modern Art Oxford, Thomson, furious[31] at Vine\'s refusal to acknowledge her debt to the Stuckists,[31] held a rival Stuckist show at the A Gallery in Wimbledon, I Won\'t Have Sex with You as Long as We\'re Married, which Vine apparently said to him on their wedding night.[31]\n\nIn September, Thomson wrote in The Jackdaw, criticising the Tate gallery for not having work by a number of figurative painters, among whom he listed Vine,[32] and said she should have been one of that year\'s Turner Prize nominees for her show at Modern Art Oxford.[33]\n\nSir Nicholas Serota Makes an Acquisitions Decision\n\nSir Nicholas Serota Makes an Acquisitions Decision, 2000.\nMain article: Sir Nicholas Serota Makes an Acquisitions Decision\nHis satirical painting of Sir Nicholas Serota, Sir Nicholas Serota Makes an Acquisitions Decision, has been widely reproduced in the media and become a Stuckist icon. It has been reviewed:\n\nThomson has painted what must be the masterpiece of Stuckism so far: Sir Nicholas Serota Makes an Acquisitions Decision. Here the slick handling and smartass irony of Britart are turned on its champion to make a very funny point and a rather good portrait. This is an example of what the Situationists called detournement, using your enemies\' own weapons against him.[34]\n\nHowever, Sarah Kent (a staunch advocate of Britart) was less impressed with the satire: \"One might forgive his puerile humour if Thomson didn\'t consider it a serious weapon ... cut the ranting and Thomson could be a reasonable painter.\"[35]\n\nThomson pointed out in response, \"it\'s reality. A few weeks after I did the painting, Tracey Emin was shown on TV getting very angry about an installation because someone had substituted another pair of knickers for hers ... That makes it a bit sad.\"[36]\n\nIn October 2006, Thomson\'s painting of Serota was exhibited during the Stuckists\' Go West show at Spectrum London gallery in London. It was suggested that this could be seen as revenge for the Tate\'s rejection of a Stuckist donation of 175 paintings the previous year.[37]\n\nArt technique\n\nI Feel Bad When I Reject Your Love\nThomson typically paints figuratively with black outlines and areas of flat colour, often brightly coloured. The painting, I Feel Bad When I Reject Your Love is not typical in this respect. He said:\n\nBased on something a (now ex) girlfriend said to me. I thought it was a negative picture, but then I realised it was positive because it’s a reconciliation after self-knowledge. It’s also ambiguous as to who’s speaking. Most of my paintings are based on experiences with people I know, usually on a drawing from life, but in this case from a photo I took of her.[2]\nThe paintings are based on spontaneous line drawings with a black wax crayon in a sketchbook. These are enlarged on the canvas. The colour is usually the first one on the canvas, though mixing it can take up to an hour.

My research in this domain has resulted in a\nbook titled \'The radically changing nature of Work, Workers &\nWorkplaces.\", which, amongst others, espouses the need for\ncorporate organizations to move away from codified management\nprocesses.

The\nresult has been great workplaces that work for workers\'s unspoken\naspirations, boosting productivity and profitability.\nI have had over two decades of having partnered with global\ncorporate organizations, and have seen how the \'workplace\' has\nchanged radically over these years. One thing remains steady\nthough; although technology has made it one large global village, the\nimportance of understanding people\'s unspoken aspirations, rooted\nwith their local culture, is paramount if we want to build workplaces\nthat work for workers.\nMy entrepreneurial journey began in 2003 with my organization\niDream and today it runs as a bespoke business consultancy with\na unique reliance on using space as a starting point of business\ntransformation.

Such space is a blend of the\nphysical workplace and a digital domain. We find out, though tried and tested\ntechniques, what end users want, and align that with the vision of the client\norganization. Such data points are then used to define the space mix that\nallows workers’ cognitive resources to flourish and lead to greater productivity.\nOrganization redesign takes a whole new meaning.\nWe help re-create organizations where ideas bounce off each other, leading to\nEureka moments.

His ever expanding musical world develops new possibilities through a deep immersion in diverse cultures.\n\n \n\nAs well as touring as a classical guitar soloist whose music expands the soundworld of the instrument, Simon has also developed some of today’s most prescient ensembles, all of which exclusively perform his original compositions and reimaginings.  Simon Thacker’s Svara-Kanti is a world leading Indo-Western community of lineups expanding on Hindustani, Carnatic, Punjabi folk and Baul spiritual influences. This has seen him tour and collaborate at major festivals in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, including for an audience of 60 000 in Dhaka and at The Sacred Pushkar, one of the region’s biggest sacred music festivals. Their 2018 Trikala double album was acclaimed across the world, notably in India and Bangladesh in major periodicals such as The Hindu, Times of India and Rolling Stone India, and won a Scottish New Music Award in 2019. MaNN Vasanai (from Trikala) was turned into a dance choreography by Piah Dance company. Simon Thacker\'s Ritmata is Simon\'s musical laboratory with three of Europe’s leading improvisers (classical guitar, piano, bass, drums). Karmana with Polish cellist Justyna Jablonska seeks a new vision for chamber music. Songs of the Roma with Justyna and Roma singer/violinist exponent Masha Natanson envisions a new Romany musical journey. All of these groups have been selected for the prestigious Made in Scotland showcase. In the studio he has taken the backwards recording technique pioneered by Jimi Hendrix and the Beatles to new heights. \n\n \n\nSimon\'s pieces have been played on radio in over 50 countries. As an educator, he has been classical guitar tutor at Edinburgh Napier University and Edinburgh College for over fifteen years. He has performed as soloist with many orchestras, including the RSNO.\n\n \n\nIn December 2019 he toured his new Pashyanti solo programme in India, including Goa and Gurgaon International Jazz Festivals, and the Delhi \"Giants of Jazz\" series. Pashyanti was selected to represent the country as part of the Made in Scotland showcase at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe. In February 2020 Simon presented an instrumental trio incarnation of Simon Thacker\'s Svara-Kanti at Celtic Connections. In March 2020 he brought the India and Bangladesh based Bengali Baul spiritual lineup of Svara-Kanti to tour Scotland. His latest album Tàradh, with Simon Thacker\'s Ritmata, was released in November 2019. The centerpiece of the album, Quadriga in 5, was nominated for the Ivors Composer Awards, the most prestigious in the UK. In July 2020 Simon brought together 19 leading musicians from 9 countries for his transformation of We Shall Overcome. His next album release will be with Songs of the Roma.\n\n\n\nPress\n\"The leader of the pack clearly is Simon Thacker. His playing affects an ethereal beauty that is unsurpassed by most musicians today... Not only is Mr. Thacker a sublime technician but his artistry seems to soar above that of most mere mortals. His ability to extract such meaning and expression from merely six nylon strings speaks of true genius.\" The World Music Report (Canada)\n\n​\n\n“Simon Thacker\'s musical life has been a journey through genres, histories, cultures and philosophies...remarkable, powerfully energetic” Elsewhere (New Zealand)\n\n​\n\n“A multifaceted exposition into a staggering range of musical styles and traditions. Thacker’s passion for discovery has led to him immersing himself in Roma gypsy culture, Indian classical music and his native Scotland’s folk scene, to name but a few.

Despite having known him for many, many years, I had no idea he had in him all the many experiences he recounts in this engaging memoir — with wit, humour, moments of sadness which emerge despite his brushing them away with witty asides.  \n\nThis book is anything but an autobiography. He talks about his life, yes, but in a novel manner, describing episodes, people he met and knew, his travels across the world in the work he did. Coming from Fiji, he studied in Delhi, went on to London as a lawyer and ended up joining the United Nations to the end of his working life. He describes in the most light-hearted manner the people he met, the number of countries and cities he travelled to, with 15 years of working in New York, spending eight years of his working life in Delhi,  and finally  in Manila. After Manila he settled down into a retired life in Delhi — after spending two years in Mumbai exploring the possibility of living there. Not satisfied with Mumbai he moved to Delhi — into a life which has been anything but retired!  Parties galore, friends all over Delhi and all over the world.\n\n \n\nHe has led a full and fancy life, which started as a fairly frugal existence as a child in Fiji where his parents went from Gujarat and where he grew up, to college in Delhi, and on to London to study law. Then the amazing life began, from studying law in England, to the UN in New York with assignments which took him around the world — from several years in New York, to Cairo and Haiti, to Caracas and Helsinki, to Jerusalem, to Delhi and on to his last posting in Manila. He was posted for eight years in Delhi, ending as head of the UN Information Centre which must have been when he decided he would spend his retirement years and where he is still in great form, partying with a host of caring and loyal friends — and editing and writing a large number of books — this being the latest one about his full and adventurous life.\n\n \n\nThe surprising aspect of the book — surprising but typical of Bhaichand — is that he mentions nothing about the very interesting work he did but concentrates on incidents, the people he met, the relations he had with them — with amusing mentions of his sexual relations from the start in college in Delhi! — but nothing about his marriage. A few mentions of his two daughters, but whose daughters?\n\nHe does not say. Who did he marry, what happened to his marriage? Who knows… What was his work like with the United Nations — that is a part of his life that Bhaichand also does not go into. Instead, he has chosen to write an altogether very entertaining story of his personal life, from the people he met, the variety of experiences he had in his life — all recounted with wit and humour and obviously with vivid memories of the several lives he has lived and the memorable relations he has had with a vast variety of people across the world. There are photographs of him with Pandit Nehru, with Indira Gandhi, with the UN Secretary-General, the King of Bhutan and, surprisingly him with two high-level Indians — Barrister Rajni Patel and Russi Karanjia — at his wedding reception who gave him his first break as a lawyer and as a journalist, after he graduated. But wife? Obviously this is something he does not want to mention. It leaves one wondering who she was and what happened to the marriage… His vast and varied experiences of life — and the people he knew — in different places across the world, are what have clearly stayed with him all these years. And they make very entertaining reading — about parties, food, sexual encounters, details about liquor and food and in the last pages a great deal about cinema. Films were a passion in his life from his very young days and it is a passion that still continues…\n\n \n\nNow he has decided to spend the last years of his life in Delhi, which he considers home more that Fiji which he left a long, long time ago. He still visits Fiji occasionally — and the US annually where both his daughters are settled — but his life is centred in Delhi along with the many, loyal friends he has.\n\nHe is a great raconteur — a book filled with incredible memoirs told in an absorbing, light-hearted manner of the many worlds he lived in, the many relationships he had, the many, many friends across the world and in Delhi where he has chosen to spend the rest of his memorable life.\n\nThe writer is an eminent film critic and historian, author and maker of documentaries, a member of several international festival juries and one of the top scholars of Asian cinema.', '2021-03-05 00:00:00', '2021-03-05 00:00:00', 0, 0, NULL),

Art columnist Kishore Singh says “if you look closely at her canvases and the tapestry of motifs unravels into more legends; turn voyeur and the epics are but a background to the unfolding melodramas of daily lives turned epic. She serves up the Upanishads and newspaper headlines in doses of caffeine. It is this that gives her canvases credible status as a chronicler of narratives past and present, Indian in their essence but universal in their context. “I am a mirror,” she says. “When I paint, you see not what I have made but what you want to see.” “I,” Seema Kohli, painter and teller of stories, “am both myth and reality. Pick the one you want, but remember, the mirror distorts, and so the myth might be reality, and reality myth.”\n\nBorn in 1960, Seema Kohli has created her own niche in the world of contemporary art since past 35 years. Her creative repertoire is eclectic, encompassing a wide range of mediums ranging from painting, murals, experiential installation performances, films to installations, sculptures and each a unique expression of her style. She has over time has brought a synergy of her unique sensibilities and her art. Working with oils on canvas, inks, mixed mediums, ceramics and printmaking, her work has redefined the basic contours of figurative art in India, finding admirers across the planet. Gifted as she is with a prolific brush of creative energy Kohli moved through the ‘Unborn Series’ and finally arrived at ‘The Golden Womb’ or the ‘Hiranya Garbha Koham’ series that propelled her into an orbit of her own.

Over a lunch dining at a high-end restaurant, Dhingra Ji and family realised how they never have to think twice about the food bill, whereas millions in the country struggle for one proper meal. That was an eye-opener for the family, following which, they decided to purchase grocery worth the same amount as their lunch bill and prepared the food in their kitchen. With this food, they fed over 400 hungry people. That day, 10 March 2015 marked as the beginning of an era- End Hunger Through Langar.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the support of friends and family, Dhingra Ji started conducting mass scale langars twice a week outside AIIMS and Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital in Delhi. There were and there continue to be operational and administrative challenges. On the positive side, Young working professionals take time out during the week to participate in the langar seva. Raman Uppal, who recently joined the initiative, says he does it for the “inner solace” he feels while feeding the needy. \n\n\n\n\n\nToday 9 different langars are conducted every week to serve primarily at the A.I.I.M.S, ESIC Basaidarapur, Hazrat Nizamuddin Station, New Delhi; District Hospital Sec-30, Noida; Civil Hospital, Sec-10, Gurugram, ESIC Medical College & Hospital, Faridabad, Delhi State Cancer Institute, East Delhi & RML Hospital Central Delhi and other Hospitals. In a month, DLSS (Delhi Langar Seva Society) is able to feed approximately 500,000 hungry souls.\n\n', '2021-03-05 00:00:00', '2021-03-05 00:00:00', 0, 0, NULL),

An Engineer by education and profession, I have served in the Indian Navy for 23 long years. I quit the Indian Navy in May 2012 as a Commander and got into Corporate Training since I wanted to pursue my dream – to train people and share my life experiences. At that point of time, I was also engaged as the Business Head (India) for the channel partners of Cummins India Ltd. to market Cummins brand of marine engines and gen-sets across India.\n\nthehumanspices_comedian_manish\n\nDuring this period, one of my very close friends from Mumbai told me about a new art form known as Stand-up Comedy and suggested that I should give it a try. It took some time to figure out where it happens in Delhi but I finally landed on stage for the very first time in August 2014.\n\nI quit my job with Cummins in June 2015 and Corporate Training took a back seat sometime in the mid of 2016. Stand-up Comedy has been a full time thing for me since then.\n\nI think I always had a funny bone in place, because as a kid, I would always entertain my family members with my jokes and observations. Being serious was not one of the things that were expected of me when I was around. Like I mentioned, when my friend introduced me to this art form and I began performing in Open Mics, I knew that this is what I wanted to do for sure.\n\nthehumanspices_comedian_manish\n\nTo begin with, it’s always your friends and your family who find you funny. They are the feeders of those funny moments in life & the ones who identify your trait and push you to give it a shot to such off-beat careers, more so at the age of 47. Also, it’s my little girl who always told me that I was the only person who made her laugh when she was down and out. That too, in the face of adversities.\n\nYou really have to push your own limits and boundaries to perform on stage. I think our life is the biggest influencer per se.\n\nMost of my content stems from a much diversified life experiences – be it at home, work or the Indian Navy. Whilst I can’t pin point at any of my works as my best, there is always an effort to improve on the content, its delivery and timing. I have been fortunate to have performed in multiple cities, many times over and each of the performances have been very close to my heart. It’s the audience that makes it special for us. Every single time!\n\nI shall be performing at Canvas Laugh Club at Gurgaon in the first week of May along with some other gigs lined up in Kolkata, Ludhiana, Pune and Chandigarh. I routinely post the details of my gigs on my social media handles. Also, I was way fortunate to be a part of a Comedy Festival at Auckland, NZ and Sydney, Australia and I hope to be able to do more performances overseas in the year 2018.', '2021-03-05 00:00:00', '2021-03-05 00:00:00', 0, 0, NULL),

We don this raiment which is a role/character on stage and which is a life in this world with the express understanding that we shall relinquish it when we are done and move on to don another but while we have this one on, we shall live it to the fullest with our complete being and total awareness. This in fact is the crux of Ank’s understanding and conduction of theatre. We do not become the character we play (on stage), we only present them on stage but while we are with them, we offer them with complete intensity and conviction. And as we go about this play, there are certain rules of the game which are only fair and just –the chappals and shoes that we leave outside when we come in for rehearsal are the egos we dispense with. But the ego is a tough fighter and does not let go that easily and therein lies some of the pain.\n\n\"I want to live as many lives as possible in this one birth\" seemed a somewhat plausible explanation to family, friends and relatives completely unable to comprehend my increasingly utter absorption with theatre. The real understanding of the words only hit me much later. Fame, learning, money and a door that will open out towards that bigger, better chance is what really brings aspirants to theatre but is not enough to keep them here if these things don’t happen soon enough. Only those who realize that fame, money and learning towards a different end have nothing to do with theatre….…remain.

She turned vegan eight years ago and that was her moment of epiphany; She realized how yoga and veganism are related – if the yogic concept of ‘Ahimsa’ (non-violence) applies to humans, shouldn’t it also apply to animals, too? This gave Kriti her mission in life: to create a community of vegan yogis and to spread awareness about yoga and veganism. \nYogific began in 2016 with a series of very small events. She realized that she could reach far more people if she organized a bigger event that brought together yogis, yoga teachers, vegan traders and vegan activists under the same roof – from there, the Yogific Yoga and Vegan Festival was born. So far, they\'ve hosted 30 events in five countries and have collaborated with over 200 teachers and 300 ethical businesses. They have a network of 150 volunteers who help us organize events. They have collaborated with the UK\'s largest vegan festival, VegfestUK, to create a Yoga zone. Yogific has also inspired several other vegan festivals in the UK to include Yoga classes as part of the event. \n\nWhile Yogific is Kriti\'s labor of love, she has a thriving career in the field of marketing and communications. She currently heads marketing for a foundation that supports tech startups in Krakow, Poland.

She claims she is getting older, but I am yet to see any telltale signs of that. The passion, the energy, the zing and her love for students and education and innovation continue unabated. Nothing has changed. If anything, her continued association with children and the education system combined with the power of technology has only added to the life of many students like me who have been lucky to be taught or guided by her. She has been a wonderful teacher, guide and mentor. Her love for the subject she was teaching –history in this case, was infectious and had us thoroughly enjoy our classes with her. Everything was made interesting and exciting in class. Classroom learning was interspersed with fun activities like museum trips and even the occasional movie trip. She was so much fun inside and outside the classroom. Always the one to show love, she had a way of ensuring that her love and regard for us did not make us indisciplined. Till date I am surprised how she manages to give out so much love to her students and still commands discipline. She says, “I tell my students that what is wrong is wrong. I will care about you but if you are wrong, I will also check you and correct you. And if you understand that then you will always have my love.” Born in Lucknow she did her initial schooling from six different schools as her father was in the army. The last seven years of her schooling was from Delhi Public School, R. K. Puram where she was the first batch of grade eleventh and twelfth. A graduation in history from LSR in 1982 and a post graduation in the same from Delhi University saw her become more and more determined about following her heart and becoming a teacher.

Since her family was not into education or had ever been in this stream, there were multiple questions and suggestions on her choice of profession. She stuck on and knew what she wanted to do. Today she shares that many of her contemporaries who had frowned upon her choice are either not working or bored with what they are doing. After her graduation she joined DPS, R. K. Puram and thus started her career at, her alma mater in 1985. She found a great mentor in Shyama Chona who was her class teacher from grade ninth to grade twelfth. When the new DPS branch was opening in Vasant Kunj, Shyama Chona pushed her to move out of R K Puram to Vasant Kunj for she saw this as a great career opportunity for Aditi to grow and spread her wings. Though upset, Aditi decided to go ahead with her teacher and mentor’s advice. She left R. K. Puram and joined Vasant Kunj in 1994 as one of the founding team.\n\nRead more at: https://yourstory.com/2015/09/aditi-misra', '2021-03-05 00:00:00', '2021-03-05 00:00:00', 0, 0, NULL),
