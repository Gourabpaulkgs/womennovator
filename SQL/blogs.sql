The first wave of feminism was more political with a thrust to gain the right for women to vote. The second wave was about equality, opportunity, and access in the workforce and sexual abuse – women, were exerting their rights at work and in personal life. In the third wave, the idea of feminism became mainstream. The focus shifted on institutional reforms to reduce gender discrimination, promote equality, and give women equal access to male-dominated spaces. The phrase \'third-wave feminism\' was coined in 1992 by Rebecca Walker, a 23-year-old Black bisexual woman. The ‘third-wave feminism’ also addressed issues that involved racism and sexual orientation. The Internet became a platform for women to connect –and share perspectives with feminists worldwide. Feminism was growing and becoming global. The fourth wave of feminism was not much of an ideological shift. It scaled the growth of the movement manifolds by leveraging media – by voicing the issues and making them reach millions. The emergence of digital technologies and social media activism propelled the trend. Women from across the globe united – <a target=\"blank\" style=\"color: blue;\" href=\"https://metoomvmt.org/\"> the MeToo movement</a> – and trans rights also became part of the conversation. Many fourth-wave feminists are working to combat exclusion and not just embrace inclusion.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 22px; font-family: arial nova;\">In 2014, Sheryl Sandberg launched the <a target=\"blank\" style=\"color: blue;\" href=\"https://banbossy.com/\">\'Ban Bossy\'</a> campaign. It was to generate awareness about the cultural expectations that shape the way girls and boys are brought up.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Girls are celebrated when they display feminine qualities like empathy, kindness, and patience.<br>- Sheryl Sandberg</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 22px; font-family: arial nova;\">According to Sandberg, when men act assertively, they are celebrated, while women are punished for exhibiting similar traits. “Girls are celebrated when they display feminine qualities like empathy, kindness, and patience.” The question is that do women need to emulate masculine traits to become successful. Do they really <a target=\"blank\" style=\"color: blue;\" href=\"https://leanin.org/book\">‘leanin’</a> to acquire the traits which have helped men lead?</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 22px; font-family: arial nova;\">Each wave identified women as \'victims\' – political, economic, cultural, social. In all waves, women were fighting for their rights. The post-pandemic wave of feminism is about finding solutions. This time women are the ‘solutions’ – the world is looking at top leadership to demonstrate empathy and resilience. The men who have <a target=\"blank\" style=\"color: blue;\" href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/danabrownlee/2020/05/07/7-leadership-traits-for-the-post-covid-19-workplace/?sh=61eef08d2d4d\">acquired these traits</a> shall continue to lead as the world prepares for the pandemic to ebb. They need to balance ‘traditional’ leadership qualities with more ‘humane’ characteristics. The latest <a target=\"blank\" style=\"color: blue;\" href=\"https://cems.app.box.com/s/6f72wtplz476t9sfc07r93ujd52kfiri\">report</a> from CEMS Alliance on</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 22px; font-family: arial nova;\">leadership in a post-COVID-19 world has ranked empathy and resilience as few of the fastest-rising traits during the pandemic. The report says, “…qualities such as assertiveness, authoritativeness and technical prowess– while valuable – are no longer as highly prized.” Menneed to step back if they fail to ‘lean in’.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 22px; font-family: arial nova;\">The solution for organizations (and individuals) to survive the disruption did not stem from any of the masculine traits -it’s the ‘female essence’ that’s distinct from men. In India, nearly <a target=\"blank\" style=\"color: blue;\" href=\"https://theprint.in/india/community-engagement-by-asha-workers-behind-indias-successful-covid-response-who-panel/588374/\">900,000 ASHA workers</a> are engaged to fight the pandemic in the rural sectors. Women entrepreneurs from the garment industry promptly switched to making masks and other protective gears – <a target=\"blank\" style=\"color: blue;\" href=\"https://labourbehindthelabel.org/the-women-who-make-your-clothes/\">eighty percent</a> of the garment workers are women.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 22px; font-family: arial nova;\">The fifth wave of feminism is an outcome of a disruption. Far from being a victim, women are becoming the solution. Women need to build communities of leaders to make this wave all-pervasive and self-sustainable. <span style=\"font-family: Times New Roman;\"><em>The great scientist Louis Pasteur said, \"Chance favors only the prepared mind.\". </em></span> The fifth wave of feminism is no longer about \'dissent\'; it\'s a disruption to course correct. We need to prepare ourselves to build communities to co-experience fulfillment at work and in personal life.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-size: 22px; font-family: arial nova;\">At Womennovator, we build <strong>Community Leaders</strong> who believe in passing the baton to others – the ‘common woman’ takes agency.</p>', 'The idea of feminism has always been synonymous with dissent.

While men continue to produce sperms throughout their lives, women are born with a fixed set of eggs. A girl child has about one million follicles (egg sacs) at birth, but by puberty, they drop down to about 300,000. Out of these, only 300 to 400 get ovulated during a woman\'s reproductive lifetime.<br></p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;font-family:arial nova;font-size:22px;\">\r\nSo how did we stop this clock from ticking? </p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;font-family:arial nova;font-size:22px;\">\r\nEgg freezing gives control to women as to when and how they wish to pursue motherhood. Would they plan better? Marry late, date longer. If women could be free of this constant ticking of their biological clocks and turn back time by freezing their eggs, they wouldn’t have to scale back their careers. Yes, you read it correctly – they no longer need to juggle between personal and professional aspirations. Even couples would like to liberate themselves of the constant pressure to plan a family; most of them prefer to settle down before they become parents. </p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;font-family:arial nova;font-size:22px;\"><a style=\"color:blue;\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/vsrr/vsrr-8-508.pdf\"><em>National Center for Health Statistics Report (2019)</em></a><em> – The General Fertility Rate (GFR) saw a reduction of 2 % from 2018 and reported 58.2 births/1000 females aged 15-44. During the same period the Birth rate for women aged 40-44 went up by 2%. </em></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;font-family:arial nova;font-size:22px;\">\r\n<strong>From Infertility to Fertility Tech</strong><strong> </strong></p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;font-family:arial nova;font-size:22px;\">\r\nUntil recently, conversations about female fertility focused primarily on the inability of women to bear a child. Society has always painted infertility as a \'women\'s problem,\' though studies have proved that only 50% of infertility cases are due to female factors. While these stigmas continue to prevail, women now have more positive attitudes towards fertility -from being a social stigma-  female fertility is becoming a personal choice. As per the American Society of Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) 2019 report, one in every five women has directly faced discrimination or prejudice tied to their infertility. Today, women are celebrating the changing perceptions and choices they have with the <a style=\"color:blue;\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/19/parenting/fertility/fertility-advances.html?module=editors-picks&action=click®ion=2\">innovations in female fertility care</a>. (Fertility care involves medical interventions and treatments like fertility analysis, egg freezing, in vitro fertilization (IVF), surrogacy, and even adoption.) </p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;font-family:arial nova;font-size:22px;\">\r\nFor a long time, the only fertility-preservation possibility for women who faced sterility from damaging treatments like chemotherapy and radiology was to freeze their embryos beforehand. In 1989, Dr. Debra Gook started working in in-vitro fertilization (IVF) at the Royal Women’s Hospital in Melbourne, Australia. Like all men and women, she prioritized her career and regrets not having a family. For a single woman, embryo-freezing means choosing a partner, or at least a sperm donor, and maybe fighting a legal battle about the custody of the fertilized eggs (embryos) in the future. If men could freeze their sperm since the 1970s, why aren\'t similar choices available to women? </p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;font-family:arial nova;font-size:22px;\">Judith Rodin, the president of Rockefeller Foundation, once remarked, “My generation fought so hard to give you choices. But choosing to leave the workforce was not the choice we thought so many would make.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;font-family:arial nova;font-size:22px;\">\r\nAt first glance, egg freezing, known as oocyte cryopreservation, seems like an ideal solution if women plan to postpone having children to the exact time when they are ready. Egg freezing became</p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;font-family:arial nova;font-size:22px;\">\r\nmainstream in 2012 when the American Society of Reproductive Medicine lifted the technique\'s \"experimental\" label. By that time, there had been more than 500 reported births from the preserved eggs. More and more women are enquiring about egg freezing treatments or oocyte cryopreservation. The procedure is simple - the unfertilized eggs are harvested from the ovaries, frozen, and stored for later use. When the woman chooses to have a baby, the frozen egg is thawed, fertilized with sperm in a lab, and implanted back into the uterus. Women are no longer tied to their fertility cycle to become mothers; they now have choices. I would call this a milestone moment for <a style=\"color:blue;\" href=\"http://womennovators.com/blog/Its-not-about-Dissent-Anymore\">feminism</a> – women now have the freedom to pause their biological clocks.</p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;font-family:arial nova;font-size:22px;\">\r\nDr. Gook continued her work to preserve fertility for cancer patients by exploring possibilities for ovarian tissue freezing and grafting. (The next innovation). The market for \'fertility tech\' has seen a massive surge since then and is growing exponentially. Today, women are freezing their eggs to pursue careers or find the right partner. The egg freezing procedure is easily accessible and acceptable to many. </p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;font-family:arial nova;font-size:22px;\">Fertility tech has shown significant market opportunities for the future.The global fertility services industry is expected to generate $25.70 billion by 2027 (CAGR of 16% in seven years)) and has raised $2.2 billion in the last five years.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;font-family:arial nova;font-size:22px;\">\r\n<strong>What women must know about Egg Freezing</strong><strong> </strong></p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;font-family:arial nova;font-size:22px;\">\r\nThe Eggs are frozen using a flash-freezing process known as vitrification. To retrieve these eggs for freezing, the patient takes hormone injections (like those taken during in-vitro fertilization). The eggs are now pumped out and frozen. It takes about three weeks to complete the egg freezing cycle.  When the woman is ready to become a mother, they are thawed and fertilized in a lab with her future partner\'s sperm to make embryos. Just as IVF is done, the fertilized embryo is placed inside the uterus to grow into babies. </p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;font-family:arial nova;font-size:22px;\">\r\nFor many, this decision is much about independence now as it is about being a mother in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;font-family:arial nova;font-size:22px;\">Apple, Facebook, and Google have announced medical benefits for women who want to freeze their eggs, and egg banks host \'egg freezing parties\' that spread awareness of its benefits.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"font-weight: 400;font-family:arial nova;font-size:22px;\">\r\n<em>“I have plenty of time to think about having kids.\" </em>Evidence has proved that egg freezing for non-medical reasons has helped women make informed decisions. <em>\"Knowing that I have 22 eggs on the ice helped me have the strength to end the relationship</em><em>.\"  </em>Women have more time to find the right partner and become emotionally and financially ready to embrace motherhood. <em>\"I\'m praying for the peace of mind,\" </em>This unfolds the debate on pay parity. The surge in the fertility tech market indicates that women want freedom and are spending billions of dollars on their fertility treatments.  Millennial women undergoing egg freezing treatment consider the procedure to be an investment in health. It\'s a vital part of women\'s healthcare - physical and mental – and organizations should make fertility care accessible and affordable to all. To achieve true <a style=\"color:blue;\" href=\"https://fortune.com/2021/04/05/fertility-care-benefits-ivf-egg-freezing-equal-pay-act/\">pay parity</a> the inclusive workplace policies must cover fertility benefits.<em> </em></p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;font-family:arial nova;font-size:22px;\">\r\nA large majority of the women who choose to freeze their eggs may never use them to grow babies. But, deciding to put the eggs on the ice can help women postpone motherhood – the potential to ‘pause’ the biological clock is thrilling and liberating.</p><p style=\"font-weight: 400;font-family:arial nova;font-size:22px;\"></p>', 'For the first time in history, more babies in the US are being born to women above the age of 30 when compared to their twenty-something counterparts.
